This project incorporates mechatronic control, through a Pi5 and six servos, as seen below by the high-level schematic.
Internetworking will allow the remote player to make moves against the robot. This will be displayed by a Pi vision camera.
The chess engine will utilize the chess bots from chess.com (Stockfish) and object detection (YOLO) to 'see' pieces.
The motivation of this project is to one day play chess with my daughter Florence remotely. Roald Dahl's Matilda
inspired me as a young child, in an attempt I hope to do the same.
